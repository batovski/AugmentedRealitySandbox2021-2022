Steps to Run Project
Open the Unity project
After opening the project, run the program in the editor by pressing the play button
Load a SUMO simulation by clicking on the load button and selecting the desired folder
Move your camera using the “W”, “A”, “S”, “D”
Zoom-in using “Z”, Zoom-out using “X”
Use the cross image to block a road / Use the five rectangular pronged image to unblock a road
Watch demo video to see example usage

Steps to use origin/destination script
Add gridDistricts and od_script python files to SUMO simulation folder
Run od_script file
Enter Y to change simulation to origin/destination (enter N to change back to random routes)
Enter the number of routes (number of origins and destinations you want to specify)
Enter origin grid based on available grids
Grids are displayed as X_Y coordinates (0_0 is bottom left of simulation)
Enter destination grid based on available grids
Refresh or reopen SUMO simulation in Unity

Future Projects
Overall, we met most of the goals that we set out to achieve with this project. However, we feel that there are additional features that can be added in the future to improve the useability. The main idea that we had would be to create a program that simulates earthquakes and floods and their effects on coastal cities. This would be used alongside our project, but will focus more on the effect on the city environment rather than the roads and traffic. This would help determine the likelihood of specific roads being destroyed, which could then be used with our project to significantly improve disaster planning and response.
